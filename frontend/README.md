# Frontend

This React application was bootstrapped with Vite. It queries the Strapi backend running on `http://localhost:1337` and renders four sections:

- **About** – artist biography and photo
- **Gallery** – list of works
- **Actualité** – news posts
- **Contact** – contact information

Start the dev server with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
